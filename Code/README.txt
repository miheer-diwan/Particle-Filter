The Code folder contains six files:
1. 'ekf_functions.py' has the ekf function definition
2. 'utility.py' has the helper functions
3. 'pf_functions.py' has the pf class and methods
4. 'pf_task_1.py' has the code for task 1 - plotting trajectories and rmse
5. 'pf_task_2_a.py' code for rmse on varied particle sizes
6. 'pf_task_2_b.py' code for ekf rmse computation


Copy the data folder in the parent folder and run the script file for execution.
The outputs will be populated in the 'Outputs' folder

pf_task_2_a.py and pf_task_2_b.py will also create a .csv file for the results.
